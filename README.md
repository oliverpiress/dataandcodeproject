# Working with Data and Code A2
> A musical composition within TunePad, attempting to recreate Duke Ellington's "Take the A Train"

## General Information
- Musical composition created with Tunepad in a Python coding environment
- Not a 1:1 replica of the song itself, rather an adaptation to see how close I can get with an unorthodox way of music production
- Project is for Working with Data and Code A2
- File contains code that is accessible through importing in Tunepad

## Usage
- To successfully use and play my project, you must download the .json file attached to this repository
- Open [_TunePad_](https://tunepad.com/)
- Import file
- Click play at the top right corner to play the whole file together

## Inspiration of the music
- My Tunepad piece was inspired by this [_Musescore_](https://musescore.com/user/801096/scores/9415417/piano-tutorial) transcription of Take the A Train, and if you listen to it you will hear the similarities!
